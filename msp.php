                        <p class="MsoNormal"><strong>What is Mild Steel Plate?</strong></p>
                        <p class="MsoNormal">Mild steel is a type of steel that has a low-carbon alloy, derived from carbon steel. It is made by combining a low amount of chromium and molybdenum with low carbon. Because of the low carbon content, mild steel is more weldable and ductile than carbon steel. Mild steel is magnetic and contains a high amount of ferrite and iron. It has various desirable characteristics, such as affordability, ease of welding, and machinability.</p>
                        <p class="MsoNormal">MS sheet is particularly useful in corrosive environments, as they offer excellent corrosion resistance properties. They provide high resistance to nitric and chloride corrosion in sulphide solutions. Additionally, these plates offer high strength, tensile, yield, mechanical strength, ductility, hardness, toughness, and more. Mild steel can be easily worked at high temperatures and shows excellent resistance to chloride crossing and cracking stress.</p>
